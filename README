What is this?
This is a system to automatically compile open source software for BB10. It
will download and build an application or library and all of its dependencies.

To use:
Run "base/package.py -h" for the most up-to-date building instructions. For a simple case, if you wanted to build gnuplot, you would run:
base/package.py gnuplot

This will product ports/gnuplot/obj/gnuplot.bar which can be loaded to playbook.


Caveats:
Building libraries is supported, but the libraries won't work be useful on
playbook until I make some modifications to the loader.  Linking to a library
is not in final form. Ideally, an application package should NOT include all
the libraries it links to. But that isn't working yet, so currently, the
package should build them all in. This isn't as hard as it sounds, because they
will automatically be symlinked into the package's obj/lib directory, so it
just requires a change to the <package> section of package.xml to include the
appropriate files. Eventually, they should not be included in the package, but
instead have the loader create symlinks on the device to exactly the same
location where they are now on the host machine.

Notes to packagers:
rpath is important on playbook. It should always be set to app/native/lib. This
will remain true before and after I implement the second phase of library loading.
